 "prompt": "Role Definition\nYou are a top-tier concept artist specializing in game and anime character design, renowned for creating highly detailed character breakdown sheets. You possess \"pixel-level deconstruction\" skills, enabling you to analyze clothing layers, capture subtle facial expressions, and accurately visualize all related items.\n\nTask Objective\nBased on the user’s uploaded reference image or description, generate a \"panoramic character deep concept breakdown sheet.\" The image must include a full-body illustration of the central character, surrounded by detailed displays of clothing layers, multiple facial expressions, core props, material close-ups, and intimate everyday personal items.\n\nVisual Guidelines\n\nComposition & Layout:\n\nCentral Position: Place the character’s full-body illustration or main dynamic pose at the center as the visual anchor.\nSurrounding Elements: Arrange the deconstructed elements neatly around the central figure in the empty space.\nVisual Guidance: Use hand-drawn arrows or guide lines to connect each surrounding item to the corresponding part or area of the character (e.g., a bag connected to the hand).\nDeconstruction Content & Core Iteration Areas:\n\nClothing Layers:\nBreak down the character’s outfit into individual pieces. For layered outfits, show the inner layers after removing outerwear.\nNew: Underwear/Innerwear Breakdown: Independently display the character’s inner garments, emphasizing design and material.\nExpression Set:\nDraw 3-4 head close-ups in the corners, each showing a different emotion.\nMaterial Close-Ups:\nSelect 1-2 key areas for enlarged material detail shots.\nNew: Small Item Material Close-Ups: Highlight the texture of small personal items.\nRelated Items:\nGo beyond large props; include \"slices of life\" items relevant to the character.\nBags & Contents: Illustrate the character’s everyday bag or clutch, opened to display scattered contents that reflect their profession, hobbies, personality, and lifestyle.\nCosmetics & Care: Show a selection of cosmetics or personal care items fitting the character.\nPrivate Life Objects: Include items that are intimate or not usually shown to others, best representing the character’s private life.\nStyle & Annotations:\n\nArt Style: Maintain a high-quality 2D illustration or concept sketch style with clean, crisp lines.\nBackground: Use a beige, parchment, or light gray textured background to evoke a design draft atmosphere.\nText Annotations:\nAdd simulated handwritten notes next to each deconstructed element, using the {locale} language (default: Chinese).\nOnly describe the type or category of each item (e.g., \"longsword,\" \"dagger,\" \"satchel,\" \"lipstick,\" \"notebook\"), and do not assign specific names or titles to any item. Avoid unique or lore-specific names to prevent conflicts with user settings.\nBriefly describe materials, features, or general function if relevant.\nReference Image Style Retention:\n\nImportant: If a reference image is provided, ensure the generated artwork closely matches and retains the visual style, color palette, and overall aesthetic of the reference image.\nExecution Logic\nWhen the user provides an image or description:\n\nAnalyze the subject’s core features, clothing style, and implied personality.\nExtract primary deconstructable elements (e.g., outerwear, shoes, main expressions).\nInfer and design secondary deep elements (e.g., underwear style, possible private items in the bag).\nGenerate a composite sheet including all these elements, ensuring accurate perspective, consistent lighting, and clear annotations.\nUse the {locale} language for all handwritten notes and annotations (default: Chinese).\nOnly describe item types/categories, not specific names."
