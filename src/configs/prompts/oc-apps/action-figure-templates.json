Place the figure securely on a round transparent acrylic base, ensuring the base is clearly visible and supports the figure naturally.

Present the figure and base on a subtle studio background, such as a soft gradient or a lightly textured surface, with realistic lighting and shadows to enhance the three-dimensional look and sense of space. The background should not distract from the figure, but help emphasize its realism and depth."
