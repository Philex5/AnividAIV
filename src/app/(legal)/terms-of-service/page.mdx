### 5.5 Refund Policy

#### 5.5.1 General Refund Policy

**All purchases are generally non-refundable**, including:

- Consumed MC credits from any source

#### 5.5.2 Subscription Cancellation and Refunds

**Monthly Subscriptions:**

- Monthly subscriptions are **non-refundable**
- When you cancel, your subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period
- No refund is provided for unused days in the current month
- Unused MC credits from the monthly allocation are forfeited upon period end

**Annual Subscriptions:**

- Annual subscriptions support **partial refunds based on monthly billing cycles**
- When you cancel, we calculate refunds using the following method:

**Refund Calculation Method:**

1. **Monthly Cycle Basis**: Your annual subscription is divided into 12 monthly credit allocations that activate on the same day each month (based on your payment date)
   - Example: If you subscribed on January 15th, credits activate on the 15th of each month

2. **Activated vs. Unactivated Months**:
   - **Activated months**: Credit batches that have been activated (available for use) are considered used and non-refundable
   - **Unactivated months**: Credit batches scheduled for future activation are refundable

3. **Refund Formula**:
   ```
   Refund Amount = Total Paid × (Unactivated Months / 12)
   ```

**Example Scenario:**

- User subscribes to Plus Annual ($252/year) on January 15th
- User cancels on March 20th
- Credits activated: January 15th (Month 1), February 15th (Month 2), March 15th (Month 3)
- Unactivated months: 9 months (April-December credits not yet activated)
- Refund calculation: $252 × (9/12) = $189.00

**Important Notes:**

- Refunds are processed to your original payment method within 5-10 business days
- Unactivated MC credits are automatically voided upon refund to prevent future use
- The minimum refund amount is $0.50; refunds below this threshold are not processed
- You can continue using the service until the end of your current period

#### 5.5.3 Refund Exceptions

Refunds outside of the annual subscription policy may be granted at our sole discretion in cases of:

- Billing errors or duplicate charges
- Technical issues preventing service access (after troubleshooting with support)
- Legal requirements in your jurisdiction

To request a refund exception, contact **support@anividai.com** within 7 days of purchase with detailed justification.
