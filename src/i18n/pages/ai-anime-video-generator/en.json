    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What generation modes are supported?",
        "answer": "The AI anime video generator supports three modes: Text-to-Video (create videos from text descriptions), Image-to-Video (animate uploaded images or use first/last frame transitions), and OC-to-Video (generate videos featuring your original characters from OC Maker)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does video generation take?",
        "answer": "Most videos are generated in 1-5 minutes, depending on the model, duration, resolution, and prompt complexity. Fast models like Veo3 Fast complete quicker, while standard models may take longer for higher quality output."
      },
      {
        "question": "What resolutions and aspect ratios are supported?",
        "answer": "Available options vary by model. Common resolutions include 720p and 1080p. Aspect ratios include 16:9 (landscape), 9:16 (portrait), and 1:1 (square). Note: 1080p is typically only available in 16:9 format. Please check the actual options when selecting your model."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I upload a reference image?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can upload 1-3 reference images depending on the model and mode. Some models support first-and-last-frame generation (2 images for transition effects), while others use a single reference image. The AI anime video generator uses these to maintain visual consistency."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I use my OC to generate videos?",
        "answer": "Create your OC in OC Maker, then select it in the AI anime video generator. The AI will feature your character's portrait as a reference image, maintaining character consistency in the generated anime video."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the video duration options?",
        "answer": "Duration options vary by model: typically 5, 10, or 15 seconds. Shorter videos use fewer credits and generate faster. Please refer to the actual model selection for available durations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I download generated videos?",
        "answer": "After generation, click the download button below the video player. Videos are downloaded in your selected resolution. Plus and Pro members can remove watermarks before downloading."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are credits calculated for videos?",
        "answer": "Credit costs vary significantly by model, resolution, and duration. Examples: Veo3 Fast ~100 credits, Veo3 Standard ~750 credits, Kling 5s ~210 credits, Wan 720p 5s ~300 credits. Always check the credit cost displayed on the generate button before creating—it reflects your actual selections."
      },
      {
        "question": "What video models are available?",
        "answer": "We offer multiple AI video models including Veo3 (fast and standard), Kling v2.5, Wan 2.5, and Sora 2 (standard and pro). Each model has different strengths—some excel at motion quality, others at character consistency. The actual available models may vary."
