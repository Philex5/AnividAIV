## Why AnividAI? Mission & Philosophy

### Our Mission

**Make everyone an anime creator—powered by AI.**

### Who is AnividAI For?

- **Anime Fans & OC Enthusiasts**: Create and visualize your original characters
- **Content Creators**: Build unique anime IPs for social media, YouTube, and streaming
- **Writers & Comic Artists**: Generate character designs, scenes, and storyboards
- **Art Lovers**: Experience the joy of anime creation without artistic skills

### Core Design Principles

1. **Character-Centric**: Your OC is the anchor—use it across all creation tools
2. **Zero Barrier**: Professional results from simple text descriptions
3. **Unified Workflow**: No platform switching—from character to art to video
4. **Community-Driven**: Share, discover, and grow with fellow creators
