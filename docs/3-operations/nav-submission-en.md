## Slogan
**AnividAI – Your AI Studio for Anime Worlds**

## Short Description
AnividAI is an all-in-one AI anime studio that integrates illustration, video generation, and character storytelling tools to streamline the creative workflow from character design to content production.

## Detail Description

### Introduction
AnividAI is more than just an AI generator; it is a comprehensive studio specifically designed for the ACGN (Anime, Comic, Game, Novel) community. We focus on Japanese anime, stylized fantasy, and game CG aesthetics, solving the industry's biggest pain point—character consistency—through our proprietary **Character Studio**. Whether you are creating high-quality character concept art, fluid anime videos, or transforming a novel into a serialized manga, AnividAI provides a seamless, professional environment to bring your imagination to life.

### Features
*   **Anime Generator**: A powerful text-to-image and image-to-image tool offering various anime art styles with precise prompt control.
*   **Anime Video Generator**: Breathes life into static images with professional camera controls and stylized animation effects.
*   **Character Studio**: Generates detailed character profiles from a single sentence, serving as a logical anchor to ensure consistent appearance across images, videos, and chats.
*   **Worlds & Chat**: Allows users to define atmospheric settings and engage in immersive, personality-driven dialogues with their created characters.
*   **Specialty Tools**: A suite of creative modules including an Action Figure Generator (3D style) and a Sticker Generator for social media.

### Benefits
*   **Effortless Consistency**: Anchor your character's visual identity across different media, eliminating the "different face every time" issue common in generic AI tools.
*   **All-in-One Creativity**: Move seamlessly from character design and scene building to final illustration and video production within a single platform.
*   **Professional ACGN Focus**: Deeply optimized for anime aesthetics, avoiding the "uncanny valley" of photorealistic models to maintain a pure fantasy art vibe.
*   **Modern Workflow**: Features a stunning "Glassmorphism 2.0" interface designed for a highly intuitive and visually pleasing creative experience.

### User Cases
*   **Anime Creators & Influencers**: Efficiently produce high-quality anime videos, illustrations, and promotional materials for social media.
*   **Indie Storytellers & Novelists**: Visualize stories by generating manga panels or promotional PVs without needing professional drawing skills.
*   **OC (Original Character) Players**: Create character reference sheets, stickers, and interactive backstories to complete their character profiles.
*   **Anime Enthusiasts**: Quickly transform dream scenarios and "what-if" moments into high-fidelity visual art.

### Planning
Our roadmap focuses on evolving from fragment generation to full-scale production by introducing the **Manga Studio** for automated paneling and the **Cinematic Video Engine** for script-driven storytelling.
